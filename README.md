# media-frameworks-html-controller 

A controller that mediates communcations with a [MediaHub](https://github.com/Colum-SMA-Dev/MediaHub) instance for Browser/HTML based clients. 

This handles all of the communications logic between a client and a hub. This module should be extended to incorporate scene display logic.
