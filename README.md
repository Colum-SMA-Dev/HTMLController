# html-controller [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Colum-SMA-Dev/HTMLController.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Colum-SMA-Dev/HTMLController.svg?branch=master)

A controller that mediates communcations with a [MediaHub](https://github.com/Colum-SMA-Dev/MediaHub) instance for Browser/HTML based clients. 

This handles all of the communications logic between a client and a hub. This module should be extended to incorporate scene display logic.
